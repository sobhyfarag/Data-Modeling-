## Project Overview: 
This is a data modeling project for optimizing the data model and data pipeline to optimize the performance of power BI 


### The Dataset:
- The dataset I've used comes from **the United States Census Bureau** and summarizes survey data asked of manufacturing firms in 2018 and 2019. It contains a variety of measures around payroll and numbers of employees for several industries according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).
